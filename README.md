# ResearchFlow

Welcome to the ResearchFlow project!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/researchflow.git
   cd researchflow
   ```

2. If you encounter a merge conflict:
   - Open the conflicted files and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   - Edit the file to keep the desired changes and remove the conflict markers.
   - After resolving, add the file and commit:
	 ```bash
	 git add <filename>
	 git commit
	 ```

For more details, see the [GitHub documentation on resolving merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts).
